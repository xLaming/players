# HTML5 radio players
My HTML players repository, you're free to use/edit it.

Well, I'm releasing these files so you can use them as a base and create your own players. 

**REMEMBER THAT I WILL NOT HELP YOU WITH THESE FILES, DO NOT ASK.**

## Replaceable
You should look for these tags in the code and replace them with their values.

  *  Your background URL, e.g: https://i.imgur.com/aaaa.png
* **{{RADIONAME}}**
  * Your radio name, eg: Test Radio
* **{{STREAM_URL}}**
  * Your streaming URL (compatible with ShoutCast & IceCast)
